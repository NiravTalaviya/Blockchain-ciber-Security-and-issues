	abstract = {In this paper, we systematically explore the attack surface of the Blockchain technology, with an emphasis on public Blockchains. Towards this goal, we attribute attack viability in the attack surface to 1) the Blockchain cryptographic constructs, 2) the distributed architecture of the systems using Blockchain, and 3) the Blockchain application context. To each of those contributing factors, we outline several attacks, including selfish mining, the 51\% attack, Domain Name System (DNS) attacks, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, consensus delay (due to selfish behavior or distributed denial-of-service attacks), Blockchain forks, orphaned and stale blocks, block ingestion, wallet thefts, smart contract attacks, and privacy attacks. We also explore the causal relationships between these attacks to demonstrate how various attack vectors are connected to one another. A secondary contribution of this work is outlining effective defense measures taken by the Blockchain technology or proposed by researchers to mitigate the effects of these attacks and patch associated vulnerabilities},

At the same time, however, its security issues are exposed constantly and cyber attacks have caused significant losses in it. At present, there is little concern and research in the field of network security of the blockchain. This paper introduces the applications of blockchain in various fields, systematically analyzes the security of each layer of the blockchain and possible cyber attacks, expounds the challenges brought by the blockchain to network supervision, and summarizes research progress in the protection technology. This paper is a review of the current security of the blockchain and will effectively help the development and improvement of security technologies of the blockchain.",

abstract="Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that uses a decentralized architecture. It has enjoyed superiority compared to other cyptocurrencies but it has also attracted attackers to take advantage of the possible operational insecurity. All the Bitcoin miners independently try to find the winning block by finding a hash lower than a particular target. On 14thJune 2014, a particular mining pool was able to take control of 51{\%} of Bitcoins processing power, thus extracting the maximum amount of profit for their work. In this paper, we introduce a new defense against this 51{\%} attack. We modify the present block header by introducing some extra bytes and utilize the Timestamp more effectively in the hash generation and suggest an alternative to the existing Proof-of-Work scheme. The proposed approach does not rely on finding a hash value lower than the target, rather it awards the miner involved in generating the minimum hash value across the entire distributed network. Fraudulent activities easily get caught due to effective use of the Timestamp. The new scheme thus introduces fair competition among the miners. Moreover, it facilitates the generation of Bitcoins at a fixed rate. Finally, we calculate and show how the new scheme can lead to an energy-efficient Bitcoin.",
